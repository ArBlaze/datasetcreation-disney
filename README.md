## Disney Wikipedia Page Scraper

Here, we create a dataset by scraping links off a Wikipedia page, then going into those links and obtaining information from the
information box of each page. We do a bit of cleaning of the data as best as we can to make it presentable. Data are then saved 
as a .json file.
