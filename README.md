Simple scraper and analysis

Not much thought put into this (yet). Scraper is pretty messy in terms of code and analysis is not done yet.

TODO:

- Fix up code so that it looks more clean
- Remove ( ) and [ ] and text in between those from release date, then afterwards convert release date to datetime object
- Fix up box office numbers so that it keeps decimal point

--------- > After those are fixed

- Simple EDA of the data
